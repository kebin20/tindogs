# tindogs
A small dating app exclusively for dogs (cats version will come soon)


Reflection and notes:

This app was a really good practice in using classes and constructors to create new instances of dogs for the Tindogs matches. It was easy for me to add new dogs by simply updating the Object. 

The Like and Nope badges were good practice in using the setTimeout() function. I struggled to try and find where to use the setTimeout function in my swipedLike and swipedNope function, but managed to correctly place it with the help of another student. 

I heavily invested time into making the website responsive to different screen sizes with an extensive use of media queries. 

Challenges:

- Struggled to find a way to show the next dog after clicking the like or nope button (Solved!)
- Had problems managing to have the like badge show while the current dog match remain in place. (solved!)
